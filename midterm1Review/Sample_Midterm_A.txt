Format: 5 multipart problems + 1 theory question. Closed book / notes unless stated. Show work.
Topics: Switching & measurements; DNS; HTTP/SMTP/IMAP/POP3; Transport issues (loss/corruption/flow/congestion);
UDP; Reliable transport (Stop-and-Wait, GBN, SR).
(Study sources: W1&2_Introduction_Network_Measurements.pdf; W345_APPLAYER_DNS_HTTP_SMTP.pdf;
W567-TRANSPORTLAYER-UDP-TCP-1.pdf — use these to review definitions, timing formulas, DNS message layout,
HTTP versions, SMTP dialogue, UDP checksum, and GBN/SR mechanics.)


Problem 1 — QUICKIES (10×3 pts = 30)
Answer in ≤2 lines.
a) Define transmission vs propagation delay. Which depends on link rate?
b) Circuit vs Message vs Packet switching: 1 pro and 1 con of each.
c) What does an NS record mean vs an A/AAAA record?
d) HTTP/1.0 vs HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 in one sentence each (focus on connections/streams).
e) Give the 5 classes of HTTP status codes and one common example in each.
f) In SMTP, is server-to-server mail push or pull? Which protocol retrieves mail for a user?
g) POP3 vs IMAP: state layout and typical user experience difference.
h) Name four UDP header fields and what they do.
i) Define flow control vs congestion control (who is being protected?).
j) Stop-and-Wait: why is utilization poor on high BDP links?

Problem 2 — PERFORMANCE I (A—R—B store-and-forward switch)
• Both links R1 = R2 = 1.0×10^6 Bytes/s.  Propagation per link t_p = 0.05 ms.
• File size F = 1000 Bytes.  Packet payload P = 100 Bytes (so N = 10 packets).
• The router must receive an entire packet before forwarding (classic store-and-forward).

2.a) Packet switching with NO per-packet processing. Compute total time end-to-end.
2.b) Same as (a), but there is per-packet router processing t_h = 0.05 ms (once per packet overall).
2.c) Message switching (whole message per hop), same R1,R2,t_p; compute total time.
2.d) Circuit switching with call setup 0.05 ms; compute total time.

Problem 3 — HTTP TIMING & CONNECTIONS
Assume RTT = 40 ms, object sizes negligible compared to RTT unless noted.
A page has: one base HTML (90 KB) and M = 6 embedded objects (each 30 KB).
Link from client to server is 90 Mb/s in both directions.

3.a) HTTP/1.0 (non-persistent), no parallel connections. Time to get the full page.
3.b) HTTP/1.1 persistent, no pipelining (send next after prior response). Time for full page.
3.c) HTTP/2 over one TCP (multiplexed). Time for full page.
(State your timing model clearly; count handshakes where relevant.)

Problem 4 — DNS (ITERATIVE RESOLUTION)
Resolver performs an ITERATIVE lookup for host x.cs.rutgers.edu.
4.a) What does the ROOT return (sections and record types)?
4.b) What does the .EDU TLD return?
4.c) What does the rutgers.edu authoritative server finally return?
4.d) If the resolver cache already has TLD NS + glue (fresh), which steps are skipped? Why?
4.e) If the A record for x.cs.rutgers.edu has TTL 600s and we query again after 5 minutes, what happens? After 15 minutes?

Problem 5 — TRANSPORT RELIABILITY / WINDOWS
Consider a one-way path with finite RTT = 100 ms. Unless noted, serialization time is negligible.
Packet payload L = 1000 bits.

5.a) Stop-and-Wait throughput and total time to send F = 1,000,000 bits.
5.b) Window-based sending with fixed W = 20 packets (BW = ∞). Give throughput and time for F above.
5.c) Exponential growth per RTT (1,2,4,8,…) until done (BW = ∞). Find number of RTTs to send N packets and total time.
5.d) Explain (one sentence) why a too-small window underutilizes a high-BDP path.

THEORY — UDP CHECKSUM & WHEN TO USE UDP (10 pts)
A) Compute the 4-bit UDP-style checksum (1’s complement over 4-bit words) for the 12-bit data:
   D = 0011 0101 1010. Show the wraparound if any and give the final checksum.
   Then verify that D + checksum gives all 1s at the receiver.
B) Name two application scenarios where UDP is preferable to TCP and explain (1–2 lines each) how the app handles reliability/ordering if needed.
