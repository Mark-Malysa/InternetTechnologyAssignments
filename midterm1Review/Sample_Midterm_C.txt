Format: 5 multipart problems + 1 theory question. Closed book / notes unless stated. Show work.
Topics: Switching & measurements; DNS; HTTP/SMTP/IMAP/POP3; Transport issues (loss/corruption/flow/congestion);
UDP; Reliable transport (Stop-and-Wait, GBN, SR).
(Study sources: W1&2_Introduction_Network_Measurements.pdf; W345_APPLAYER_DNS_HTTP_SMTP.pdf;
W567-TRANSPORTLAYER-UDP-TCP-1.pdf — use these to review definitions, timing formulas, DNS message layout,
HTTP versions, SMTP dialogue, UDP checksum, and GBN/SR mechanics.)


Problem 1 — DEFINITIONS / CONSEQUENCES (10×3 pts)
a) Give the DNS header flags RD and RA meanings.
b) What is cookie state in HTTP? List the four participants.
c) Persistent HTTP: name two benefits and one operational tradeoff.
d) SMTP numeric replies: what do 220, 250, 354, 221 mean?
e) What fields make TCP/UDP demultiplexing possible?
f) Define cumulative ACK. Why does TCP use it?
g) Give two causes of packet loss in routers.
h) Give two reasons an application would choose UDP.
i) What is “glue” again, and why can’t root give you the final A?
j) One sentence: why SR window ≤ half the sequence space.

Problem 2 — PIPELINE WITH THREE HOPS
S—R1—R2—D (three store-and-forward hops). All links 1.5×10^6 B/s; t_p per hop 0.03 ms.
P=150 B; file F=1500 B. No per-packet processing.

2.a) Compute total time end-to-end.
2.b) Now R2’s link rate drops to 0.5×10^6 B/s. Recompute and identify the bottleneck.

Problem 3 — MIXED HTTP OBJECTS
RTT = 50 ms; symmetric 100 Mb/s. Base 60 KB, CSS 20 KB, JS 40 KB, 8 images 25 KB each.
Assume browsers on HTTP/1.1 can fetch up to 6 parallel objects per host (connection coalescing off).
3.a) HTTP/1.1 persistent with up to 6 parallel connections, no pipelining. Estimate total time.
3.b) HTTP/2 over one TCP. Estimate time.

Problem 4 — DNS “WHAT’S IN WHICH SECTION?”
During an iterative resolution for z.example.edu:
4.a) Name exactly which records (types) you expect in Answer, Authority, Additional from ROOT, from .EDU, and from example.edu’s authoritative server.
4.b) Explain how TTL and caching reduce future queries for the same name and which entries are likely cached.

Problem 5 — UDP + GBN/SR TIMELINES
RTT=80 ms, BW=∞, L=1000 bits.
5.a) Stop-and-Wait: time to send N=400 packets.
5.b) Window W=32: give throughput and total time.
5.c) Losses at pkts (13, 17) within one window. Draw/describe which retransmissions occur under GBN vs SR and how ACKs advance.

THEORY — Email stack: Compare SMTP vs IMAP vs HTTP webmail in one cohesive diagram (text OK). Explain who speaks to whom and over which protocol in 8–10 lines.
