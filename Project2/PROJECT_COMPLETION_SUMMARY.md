# DNS Project Completion Summary

## Project Status: ‚úÖ ALL PARTS COMPLETED AND TESTED

---

## Part A: Recursive Resolver (25%) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### What Was Fixed/Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Added main loop to read questions from `Input.json`
2. ‚úÖ Added error handling for TC (truncation) and RA (recursion available) flags
3. ‚úÖ Added output file writing to `output_partA.json`
4. ‚úÖ Increased UDP buffer from 512 to 4096 bytes
5. ‚úÖ Added proper response validation and error reporting

### How to Run:
```bash
python3 Project2_PartA_skeleton.py
```

### Test Results:
- ‚úÖ Successfully resolves A records (IPv4)
- ‚úÖ Successfully resolves AAAA records (IPv6)
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple answers correctly
- ‚úÖ Output saved to `output_partA.json`

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "id": 43316,
  "qr": 1,
  "opcode": 0,
  "aa": 0,
  "tc": 0,
  "rd": 1,
  "ra": 1,
  "rcode": 0,
  "answers": [
    {
      "type": "A",
      "ip": "128.6.13.2",
      "ttl": 3600
    }
  ],
  "question": {
    "qname": "ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu",
    "qtype": 1
  }
}
```

## Part B: NS Records Support (25%) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### What Was Fixed/Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Added parsing for Authority section (NSCOUNT)
2. ‚úÖ Added parsing for Additional section (ARCOUNT)
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `rdata_start` bug (was `offset`, now `offset - rdlength`)
4. ‚úÖ Added file I/O with command-line argument support
5. ‚úÖ Properly parses NS records with name compression
6. ‚úÖ Added error handling

### How to Run:
```bash
# Use default Input.json
python3 Project2_PartB_skeleton.py

# Or specify a custom input file
python3 Project2_PartB_skeleton.py Input_partB.json
```

### Test Results:
- ‚úÖ Successfully queries and parses NS records
- ‚úÖ Correctly parses authority and additional sections
- ‚úÖ Handles name compression in NS records
- ‚úÖ Output saved to `output_partB.json`

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "id": 29166,
  "ancount": 5,
  "nscount": 0,
  "arcount": 0,
  "answers": [
    {
      "hostname": "rutgers.edu",
      "ttl": 1964,
      "atype": 2,
      "rtype": "NS",
      "nsname": "ns1.rutgers.edu"
    }
  ],
  "authorities": [],
  "additionals": []
}
```

## Part C: Iterative Resolver (50%) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### What Was Fixed/Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed `rdata_start` bug in `parse_rr()` function
2. ‚úÖ **REMOVED incorrect RA (recursion available) check** for iterative queries
3. ‚úÖ Fixed glue record search logic (was returning error too early)
4. ‚úÖ **Added TCP fallback** for truncated responses from root servers
5. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive file I/O with question tracking
6. ‚úÖ Improved debugging output showing query progression
7. ‚úÖ Properly follows referrals through DNS hierarchy

### Critical Bug Fixes:
- **Bug 1**: `rdata_start = offset` ‚Üí `rdata_start = offset - rdlength`
- **Bug 2**: Removed RA check (doesn't apply to iterative/non-recursive queries)
- **Bug 3**: Fixed glue record search logic to properly iterate through all NS records
- **Bug 4**: Added TCP support for handling truncated responses (TC=1)

### How to Run:
```bash
python3 Project2_PartC_skeleton.py
```

### Test Results:
- ‚úÖ Successfully performs iterative resolution from root servers
- ‚úÖ Handles TCP fallback for truncated root server responses
- ‚úÖ Correctly follows referrals through DNS hierarchy:
  - Root server (198.41.0.4) ‚Üí .edu TLD server ‚Üí Authoritative server
- ‚úÖ Successfully resolves domains with glue records
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Correctly returns error for domains without glue records (as per spec)

### Resolution Flow Example:
```
1. Query root server (198.41.0.4)
   - Gets truncated response (TC=1)
   - Retries with TCP ‚úì
   - Receives .edu TLD referral

2. Query .edu TLD server (192.31.80.30)
   - Receives rutgers.edu NS referral with glue records

3. Query authoritative server (130.156.133.30)
   - Receives final answer: 128.6.13.2
```

### Output:
```json
{
  "question": {
    "qname": "ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu",
    "qtype": 1
  },
  "answers": [
    {
      "hostname": "ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu",
      "ttl": 3600,
      "atype": 1,
      "rtype": "A",
      "ip": "128.6.13.2"
    }
  ]
}
```

- ‚úÖ Question section handling with proper QNAME encoding
- ‚úÖ Answer section parsing (A, AAAA, NS records)
- ‚úÖ Authority section parsing
- ‚úÖ Additional section parsing (glue records)
- ‚úÖ DNS name compression handling

### Network Features:
- ‚úÖ UDP socket communication
- ‚úÖ TCP socket communication (for Part C)
- ‚úÖ Proper timeout handling (5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Buffer size optimization (4096 bytes)
- ‚úÖ TCP fallback for truncated responses

- ‚úÖ Truncation detection (TC flag)
- ‚úÖ Recursion availability check (RA flag) for Parts A & B
- ‚úÖ DNS error codes (RCODE)
- ‚úÖ Missing glue record detection
- ‚úÖ Timeout handling

## Files Generated

1. **output_partA.json** - Results from recursive resolver (Part A)
2. **output_partB.json** - Results from NS record queries (Part B)
3. **output_partC.json** - Results from iterative resolver (Part C)

---

## Wireshark Capture Instructions

### For All Parts:

**Option 1: Using tshark**
```bash
tshark -i any -f "udp port 53 or tcp port 53" -w project2_partA.pcap
# Run your Python script in another terminal
# Stop tshark with Ctrl+C
```

**Option 2: Using Wireshark GUI**
1. Start Wireshark
2. Select interface 'any'
3. Set capture filter: `udp port 53 or tcp port 53`
4. Start capture
5. Run your Python script
6. Stop capture
7. Save as:
   - `project2_partA.pcap` for Part A
   - `project2_partB.pcap` for Part B
   - `project2_partC.pcap` for Part C

**Important for Part C:** Make sure to capture BOTH UDP and TCP traffic since Part C uses TCP fallback for truncated responses!

---

## Known Limitations (As Per Project Spec)

1. **No Glue Records**: Part C will return an error for domains where authoritative NS servers don't provide glue records (e.g., `www.princeton.edu`, `whale.stanford.edu`). This is expected behavior per the project requirement: *"Assume glue records are always available. If not, return an error."*

2. **CNAME Records**: Parts A and B skip CNAME records (type 5). This is acceptable for the basic implementation.
