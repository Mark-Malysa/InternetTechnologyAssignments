# Wireshark Questions - Answers with Hexadecimal Values

## Part A: Recursive Resolver (Questions 1-4)

### Question 1: Domain name in question section (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
05 69 6c 61 62 31 02 63 73 07 72 75 74 67 65 72 73 03 65 64 75 00
```

**Breakdown:**
- `05` = Length byte (5 characters)
- `69 6c 61 62 31` = "ilab1" in ASCII
- `02` = Length byte (2 characters)
- `63 73` = "cs" in ASCII
- `07` = Length byte (7 characters)
- `72 75 74 67 65 72 73` = "rutgers" in ASCII
- `03` = Length byte (3 characters)
- `65 64 75` = "edu" in ASCII
- `00` = Null terminator (end of domain name)

**Explanation:** This is the DNS wire format encoding of "ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu" where each label is prefixed by its length.

### Question 2: Domain name in answer section (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
c0 0c
```

**Explanation:** The domain name in the answer section uses DNS **message compression**. Instead of repeating the full domain name, it uses a 2-byte pointer:
- `c0` = 11000000 in binary (top 2 bits set indicate this is a pointer)
- `0c` = Offset 12 (decimal) from the start of the DNS message

This pointer points back to where "ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu" was first encoded in the question section (at byte offset 0x0c = 12 from the DNS header start).

**Why compression?** DNS uses compression to save space by avoiding repetition of domain names in responses.

### Question 3: RDLENGTH field value (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
00 04
```

**Explanation:** 
- RDLENGTH = 0x0004 = 4 bytes (decimal)
- This makes sense because an IPv4 address (A record) is exactly 4 bytes long
- Format: 2-byte field in network byte order (big-endian)

---

### Question 4: IP address in response (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
80 06 0d 02
```

**Explanation:**
Converting each byte to decimal:
- `80` (hex) = 128 (decimal)
- `06` (hex) = 6 (decimal)
- `0d` (hex) = 13 (decimal)
- `02` (hex) = 2 (decimal)

**IP Address:** 128.6.13.2

---

## Part B: NS Records (Questions 5-7)

### Question 5: QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
QDCOUNT: 00 01
ANCOUNT: 00 02
NSCOUNT: 00 00
ARCOUNT: 00 00
```

**Explanation:**
- **QDCOUNT:** 0x0001 = 1 question in the query
- **ANCOUNT:** 0x0002 = 2 answer records (2 NS records)
- **NSCOUNT:** 0x0000 = 0 authority records
- **ARCOUNT:** 0x0000 = 0 additional records

These are 2-byte fields in the DNS header that indicate how many records are in each section.

---

### Question 6: RDLENGTH for each resource record (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
Answer Record 1 (ns1.rutgers.edu):  00 06
Answer Record 2 (runs2.rutgers.edu): 00 08
```

**Explanation:**
- **First NS record:** RDLENGTH = 0x0006 = 6 bytes
  - Contains: `03 6e 73 31 c0 0f` (encoding of "ns1" + pointer to ".rutgers.edu")
  
- **Second NS record:** RDLENGTH = 0x0008 = 8 bytes
  - Contains: `05 72 75 6e 73 32 c0 0f` (encoding of "runs2" + pointer to ".rutgers.edu")

RDLENGTH specifies how many bytes are in the RDATA (resource data) field.

---

### Question 7: Name server names (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**

**NS Record 1: ns1.rutgers.edu**
```
03 6e 73 31 c0 0f
```
Breakdown:
- `03` = Length (3 bytes)
- `6e 73 31` = "ns1" in ASCII
- `c0 0f` = Compression pointer to "rutgers.edu" at offset 0x0f (15)

**NS Record 2: runs2.rutgers.edu**
```
05 72 75 6e 73 32 c0 0f
```
Breakdown:
- `05` = Length (5 bytes)
- `72 75 6e 73 32` = "runs2" in ASCII
- `c0 0f` = Compression pointer to "rutgers.edu" at offset 0x0f (15)

**Full encoding (if expanded):**
- ns1.rutgers.edu: `03 6e 73 31 07 72 75 74 67 65 72 73 03 65 64 75 00`
- runs2.rutgers.edu: `05 72 75 6e 73 32 07 72 75 74 67 65 72 73 03 65 64 75 00`

## Part C: Iterative Resolver (Questions 8-10)

### Question 8: TYPE field in first DNS query (hexadecimal)

**Answer:**
```
00 01
```

**Explanation:**
- TYPE = 0x0001 = Type A record
- This indicates the query is asking for an IPv4 address
- The first DNS query goes to the root server (198.41.0.4)
- Query: "What is the A record for ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu?"

**Other TYPE values for reference:**
- `00 02` = NS (Name Server)
- `00 05` = CNAME (Canonical Name)
- `00 1c` = AAAA (IPv6 address)

---

### Question 9: TYPE field values in first DNS response (by section)

**Answer:**

**Authority Section (NSCOUNT = 13):**
```
All records have TYPE: 00 02 (NS records)
```
The root server responds with 13 NS records, all pointing to .edu TLD name servers:
- d.edu-servers.net
- b.edu-servers.net
- f.edu-servers.net
- h.edu-servers.net
- l.edu-servers.net
- j.edu-servers.net
- e.edu-servers.net
- c.edu-servers.net
- a.edu-servers.net
- g.edu-servers.net
- i.edu-servers.net
- m.edu-servers.net
- k.edu-servers.net

**Additional Section (ARCOUNT = 26):**
```
TYPE: 00 01 (A records) - IPv4 addresses for the NS servers
TYPE: 00 1c (AAAA records) - IPv6 addresses for the NS servers
```
The additional section contains "glue records" - the IP addresses of the name servers listed in the authority section. Mix of:
- 13 A records (IPv4 addresses)
- 13 AAAA records (IPv6 addresses)

**Explanation:** 
- Authority section tells you WHO to ask next (.edu name servers)
- Additional section tells you WHERE they are (their IP addresses - glue records)
- No answers because the root server doesn't know the final answer, it just refers you to the .edu TLD

### Question 10: Destination IP of second DNS query (hexadecimal) and where it came from

**Answer:**

**Destination IP (hexadecimal):**
```
c0 1f 50 1e
```

**Destination IP (decimal):**
```
192.31.80.30
```

**Conversion:**
- `c0` (hex) = 192 (decimal)
- `1f` (hex) = 31 (decimal)
- `50` (hex) = 80 (decimal)
- `1e` (hex) = 30 (decimal)

**Where did this IP come from?**

This IP address came from the **Additional Records section** (glue record) of the first DNS response from the root server (198.41.0.4).

**Detailed explanation:**

1. **First query:** Your resolver asked the root server (198.41.0.4) for ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu

2. **First response:** The root server replied:
   - Authority section: "Ask the .edu TLD servers, specifically d.edu-servers.net"
   - Additional section: "By the way, d.edu-servers.net has these IPs:"
     - A record: `192.31.80.30` ‚Üê **THIS IS THE IP!**
     - AAAA record: `2001:500:856e::30`

3. **Second query:** Your resolver uses the glue record IP (192.31.80.30) to query d.edu-servers.net

**Hex location in first response:**
At offset 0x0120 in the additional section:
```
c0 32 00 01 00 01 00 02 a3 00 00 04 c0 1f 50 1e
```
Where:
- `c0 32` = Compressed name (d.edu-servers.net)
- `00 01` = TYPE A
- `00 01` = CLASS IN
- `00 02 a3 00` = TTL
- `00 04` = RDLENGTH (4 bytes)
- `c0 1f 50 1e` = IP address 192.31.80.30

**Why is this important?**
This is called a "glue record." Without it, there would be a circular dependency - you'd need to ask the .edu servers where the .edu servers are! Glue records break this circular dependency by providing the IP addresses directly.
