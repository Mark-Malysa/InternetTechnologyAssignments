Project 3: Reliable UDP (RUDP) Implementation and Packet
Capture
Released: October 23, 2025 Due: November 10, 2025
Total Points: 100 Mode: Individual or Group of 2
1. Objective
In this project, you will design and implement a simplified Reliable UDP (RUDP) protocol on top of UDP
sockets. Your implementation will demonstrate how TCP achieves reliable, ordered delivery through: A
three-way handshake (connection setup) Stop-and-wait reliability (sequence numbers, ACKs,
timeouts, and retries) A FIN / FIN-ACK teardown (connection close) You will verify correctness by
recording Wireshark captures (.pcap) of your implementation. Your server must intentionally
introduce random ACK delays so that the client experiences timeouts and retransmits, mimicking real
network latency.
2. Assigned UDP Port
Each student or team is assigned a unique UDP port (e.g., 30001–30100). Use this same port in both
client and server. ASSIGNED_PORT = 30077 SERVER = ("127.0.0.1", ASSIGNED_PORT) nn Use
only your assigned port — using another team's port may cause conflicts during grading.
3. Provided Files
You are provided exactly two skeleton files: rudp_client_skeleton.py rudp_server_skeleton.py
These include constants for message types and helper functions (pack_msg(), unpack_msg()). You
must complete all TODO sections to implement: Three-way handshake Reliable stop-and-wait data
transfer Connection teardown (FIN / FIN-ACK) Random ACK delay logic on the server to simulate
network jitter
4. Protocol Specification
Type Code Purpose
SYN 1 Client initiates connection
SYN-ACK 2 Server acknowledges SYN
ACK 3 Client confirms connection
DATA 4 Data segment with sequence number
DATA-ACK 5 ACK for received DATA
FIN 6 Client requests close
FIN-ACK 7 Server confirms closure
5. Implementation Tasks
A. Three-Way Handshake
Implement: Client → Server : SYN Server → Client : SYN-ACK Client → Server : ACK After successful
setup: [CLIENT] Connection established [SERVER] Connection established B. Reliable Data Transfer
(Stop-and-Wait with Random Delay)
Split your message into ~200-byte chunks (seq = 0, 1, 2, ...). Client sends DATA(seq=n) and waits for
DATA-ACK(seq=n). If no ACK arrives within timeout (RTO ≈ 0.5s), client retransmits. Server must
insert a random ACK delay before replying: import random, time delay = random.randint(100, 1000) #
milliseconds time.sleep(delay / 1000.0) Set client retry limit high (e.g., RETRIES = 10) so
retransmissions occur under long delays. C. Connection Teardown
Implement clean closing: Client → Server : FIN Server → Client : FIN-ACK After completion: [CLIENT]
Connection closed [SERVER] Connection closed
6. Wireshark Capture Requirements
Capture actual packets using Wireshark. Apply filter udp.port == <your_assigned_port> and save:
project3_handshake.pcap – SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK project3_data.pcap – DATA and DATA-ACK
(showing retries) project3_teardown.pcap – FIN and FIN-ACK Ensure your captures show
retransmissions caused by delayed ACKs.
7. Report Requirements
Your report.pdf must include: Implementation Summary: explain handshake, data transfer (with
delay), and teardown logic. Capture Analysis: describe what each .pcap file shows and how
retransmissions appear. Discussion: why ACK delay triggers retransmission and how your RUDP
ensures reliable delivery. Only .pcap captures are accepted; screenshots are not required.
8. Submission
Submit a ZIP file named <netid>_project3.zip containing: rudp_client.py rudp_server.py
project3_handshake.pcap project3_data.pcap project3_teardown.pcap report.pdf If working in a group
of 2, submit only one ZIP file with both names and NetIDs clearly mentioned in the report. Submit on
Canvas by 11:59 PM, November 10, 2025.
